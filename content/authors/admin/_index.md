# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: 'I am interested in improving cognitive abilities in children with/without neurodevelopmental disorders for educational or therapeutic purposes, using technology-based interventions such as computerized executive function games, EEG neurofeedback, and non-invasive brain stimulation. This interest further stimulates my secondary research line - characterizing brain and cognitive development, which could provide useful information when designing interventions.'
